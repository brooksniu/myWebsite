            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <hr>
            <p id="statement">Welcome! I am a third-Year UCSD student double majored in Computer Science and Cognitive Science Machine Learning. I enjoy learning and building 
                stuff with my growing knowledge. I am interested in machine learning and web development and have always been striving to find meaningful ways to combine these two.
                Throughout these years at UCSD I have systematically learned various algorithms, programming languages, machine learning mechanisms and most importantly, the 
                mindset as a software engineer which grants me diligence and meticulousness.
